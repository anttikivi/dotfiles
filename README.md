# Dotfiles

This is the Git reposiory for my workstation configuration and configuration
files. The goal of this configuration is to automate setting up and updating
programs and configurations on the workstations I use.

The configuration system is currently under revamp. Iâ€™m trying out
[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) as the new way to manage the
configuration files.

## Bootstrapping

Run the following command:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anttikivi/etc/main/bootstrap)"
